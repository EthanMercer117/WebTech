        <h1>Escape The Room Menu Test</h1> <!-- Title of the game here? -->

        <div id="LeftCol"> <!-- The left col could display a brief synopis of the game - what the player is getting into -->

          <p>The text within this box could be used to give a brief synopsis of the game / story that the user will be partaking input.
          It can be brief, or long, but it might be helpful for the user to know what they're getting into before the timer begins or /
          it might make the user more intrigued to play it - or this could be replaced with other information or scrapped entirely if we feel like
          it isn't really needed.</p>

        </div>

        <div id="RightCol"> <!-- The right col could display how the game will work - what the player can expect to do -->


        <img src="images/LayoutExample.png" alt="Layout example"> <!-- A brief showcase of an example layout of the main game -->

        <p>This column could be used to show the user what the GUI will look like once they start the game; of course the example on the right would be changed to an actual screenshot
           of the game or a more detailed demonstration (I just wanted to throw one up there as an example), so that they don't have to waste as much time figuring out where everything is located.
           Again, like the left column, this can be used for something else or scrapped entirely in the final product.</p>
